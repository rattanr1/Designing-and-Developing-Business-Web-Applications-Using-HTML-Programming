                                    #### Fundamentals of Web Development (2nd edition) ####

 I took MIS 3313 from my university, which is an an introduction to the technologies and languages used to develop and operate business 
 and e-commerce Web sites with focus on client-side technologies. I took this for fun (as an elective) to learn HTML coding and to design simple websites :)
