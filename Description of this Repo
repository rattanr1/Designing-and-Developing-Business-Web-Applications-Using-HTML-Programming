                                    #### Fundamentals of Web Development (2nd edition) ####

 I took MIS 3313 from my university, which is an an introduction to the technologies and languages used to develop and operate business 
 and e-commerce Web sites with focus on client-side technologies. I took this for fun (as an elective) to learn HTML coding and to design simple websites :)
 
You will notice more folders within folders, and that is intentional for the codes to work and pull the files from in order to display the webpage within the codes.

I mainly used Notepad++ for source code editing to write the HTML codes. And the cool thing with it is that I can examine my webpage, or any for that matter, 
by dragging the tab within Notepad++ to decipher the codes and why it displays as it is. 

I uploaded the instructions for the given tasks, HTML codes for each task, and the output of them.
