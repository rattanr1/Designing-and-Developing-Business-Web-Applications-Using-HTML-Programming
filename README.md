                #### Fundamentals of Web Development (2nd edition) ####

 I took MIS 3313 from my university, which is an an introduction to the technologies and languages used to develop and operate business 
 and e-commerce Web sites with focus on client-side technologies. I took this for fun (as an elective) to learn HTML coding and to design simple websites :)
 
You will notice more folders within folders, and that is intentional for the codes to work and pull the files from in order to display the webpage within the codes.

I mainly used Notepad++ for source code editing to write the HTML codes. And the cool thing with it is that I can examine my webpage, or any for that matter, 
by dragging the tab within Notepad++ to decipher the codes and why it displays as it is. And then I save the file as depending if it is .html, .css, .jpg, or .js.

You should save all the files within the corresponding folder as it is and open the .html ones for the website to display.

Finally, I uploaded the instructions for the given tasks, HTML codes for each task, and the output of them.
